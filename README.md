# randomPswrdGenr8r

all credit to the functionality of this password generator goes to my instructer. I take no credit for building this elegant piece of code. I did however spend atleast 12 hours on this and still just to get to this point. The amount of effort i put into this is not reflected yet with the finished product as i spent most the time stumbling over myself, googleing, cut, copy and past...ing and getting no where near with what the assignment was requesting.... 

I almost gave up, still feel like i should, but i wont. Im going to fake it until i make it, 

notice there is three .js files:
one (scriptch.js) is my first attempt and the 
second (igotit.js) is the result of me disecting a recorded video of class.
third (script.js) is what was provided

the second one igotit.js is the script you will see on the deployed site.

proly screen shot here of all three .js files

and again i feel like 1000% imposter right now.

i didnt have time to make it pretty, it is a basic utility of a site, not much to remember.

i WILL do justice by this as i get better and understand what im doing.
